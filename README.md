Features:
Create Account: Users can create new bank accounts with unique account numbers and holder names.
Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their accounts.
Withdraw: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
Transfer: Users can transfer funds between their accounts or to other accounts.
Data Persistence: Account information is stored in a file (banky_data.ser) using serialization, ensuring data persistence between program executions.
