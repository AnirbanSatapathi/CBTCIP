# BankY 
BankY is a basic banking system simulation implemented in Java. It allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and transferring funds between accounts.

Features:
Create Account: Users can create new bank accounts with unique account numbers and holder names.
Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their accounts.
Withdraw: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
Transfer: Users can transfer funds between their accounts or to other accounts.
Data Persistence: Account information is stored in a file (banky_data.ser) using serialization, ensuring data persistence between program executions.

# Guess The Number Application
Guess The Number Application is a simple game implemented in Java using Java AWT for user interaction. It generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

Features:
User Interaction: The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction using Java AWT components.
Random Number Generation: A random number is generated between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.
Limited Attempts: The user has a limited number of attempts (configurable) to guess the correct number.
Score Tracking: The user's score is calculated based on the number of attempts left when they guess the correct number.
Usage:
Compile and run the GuessTheNumberApplication.java file.
The application window will appear, prompting you to enter your guess.
Enter your guess in the provided text field and click the "Submit" button.
You will receive feedback on whether your guess is correct or not, along with your remaining attempts.
Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
